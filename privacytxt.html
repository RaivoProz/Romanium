    <h1 class="text_font">1. What Is a Privacy Policy?</h1>
    <p>A basic privacy policy outlines your website’s relationship with users’ personal information.</p>

    <p>To succeed online and avoid legal turmoil, your website needs a privacy policy agreement. The first step to creating a compliant and comprehensive privacy policy is understanding exactly what that is.</p>

    <p>Privacy Policy Definition</p>
    <p>A privacy policy is a legal document that informs your site’s users about how you collect and handle their personal information. You may also hear privacy policies referred to by the following names:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Privacy notice</li>
      <li>Privacy policy statement</li>
      <li>Privacy page</li>
      <li>Privacy clause</li>
      <li>Privacy agreement</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A general privacy policy explains a platform’s interactions with the personal information and personally identifiable information (PII) of its users. PII is information that can be used by itself, or combined with other information, to
      identify an
      individual.</p>

    <p>Specific platforms or services may require a unique privacy policy template. Examples include:</p>

    ...............app privacy policies
    privacy policies for Blogger
    WordPress privacy policies
    ecommerce privacy policies
    However, a standard privacy policy template will likely satisfy user demands and legal requirements for your website.

    Standard Privacy Policy for Website
    We’ll dive into details later on in What to Include in a Boilerplate Privacy Policy, but a basic privacy policy outlines the following:

    What information is collected
    Where information is collected from
    Why information is collected
    How information is collected (including through cookies and other tracking technologies)
    Who information is shared with or sold to
    What rights users have over their data
    The site’s contact details
    Privacy policies should be clear, thorough, and easy for internet users to find on any given site...........
